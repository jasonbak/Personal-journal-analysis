September
1: -Cornell is quaint and quiet. I went there in the summer so I wasn't able to see and observe the student body, but I got a secluded feeling when I was there. The surroundings are all rural communities and beautiful landscapes so the only people I would interact with are people from Cornell and that's why I love it. Since you're so affected by the people you're around, I'd much rather be around with just sweet, friendly, and intelligent cornellians. Compared to other schools like Columbia, where the campus is basically the city so you get molded into a certain type of person rather, at Cornell, you have a diverse and unique student body so you can find the type of person you are/want to be while being unfettered by any social stigmas by the surrounding environment. Since the student body is so diverse and unique, you will most definitely find a group of people to call your close friends so you'll always feel comfortable to call it your home. Also, everybody is so friendly there. And humble. I've been to Columbia and Harvard before and you get a vibe that people there think that they're better than everyone whom visits (that might be true in some respects, but I personally hate interacting with people who have a superiority complex, whether its justified or not). Obviously the academics there are amazing, considering it's an Ivy League. I think at a certain point though, you stop looking at colleges for their academic excellence and more for their environment. More so at the people there; you look at whether or not you can see yourself fitting there and whether or not you want to turn more or less turn into the general type of person there. You really want to find a place you can call your home-so having a student body that you love is quintessential for finding a home away from home. All top tier colleges offer about the same-level of education so I'm not worried at all about getting a quality education. There's actually a co-op program where students are able to work for 2 semesters and still graduate within 4 years. The companies who participate in co-op programs are the companies who hire cornellians right after graduation so it's a good way for students to introduce themselves as viable candidates to these interested companies. And the research they do there is absolutely amazing. Their facilities are so absolutely up to date. They have all the apparatuses you could ever think of to use for experimentation. The fact that their 3D printers are available to the entire student body gives you an idea of the extent of the availability of scientific instruments Cornell has.

For the picture, we sat around McCaf and pointed at him, he did a typical Asian peace sign pose. We also all did the Usain Bolt. After the senior picture, we went to the turf to take pictures. Some girls wanted to take pictures of us so I said “we’re like a boy band. We’re like One Direction- WON DIRECTION” “Huang Direction?” Thus Huang Direction came to be.

-Sent this message to MotivatingGiraffe on Reddit:
Hey dude,
I'm going through a tough time right now. I was hoping you could draw something that would cheer me up and give me some motivation to keep on going.
Growing up, my family and I always thought that I was gonna end up going to an Ivy League school. Now as a senior, I'm applying to colleges and the prestige of most of the colleges I'm applying to aren't at the level of the Ivy League schools, and I think I won't end up in those type of schools. I know I'm a really fortunate guy for growing up with a loving family and in a great environment, but it's still really depressing for me to realize that I'm not good enough. I've always pushed myself, thinking that I was in the top percent of my school. I took the hardest classes my school offers as well as rigorous extra-curriculars. I succeeded in most of these things, but I'm starting to think that the only reason why I succeeded was because of those that helped me. I don't think I could have achieved the success I achieved in high school without the tremendous help of my friends and sisters. 
I'm writing required essays for schools I'm applying to right now, and I lost motivation because I don't think I'm good enough to write a good essay and go there (i feel like im getting dumber in my senior year). I also lost motivation to go school and do school work -- i just want to stay home and sleep. I feel like I'm completely average or maybe a little bit above average. I sound like such a jackass right now, but always thinking that you were incredibly smart and realizing that you're not is really disheartening. I actually don't even want to go to college anymore because of the fact that I need to write essays for it. I need motivation, and I think I found it.
My dream was always to get into a great (ivy league) college -- that thought was always in my head and it's what fueled everything I did in high school and prior. But one night in the summer, I had this vision. And this vision brings me so much happiness thinking about it even now when I think I reach an all-time low (i've been crying for the past few hours). I really want a picture of it made by you
	I dream of myself in my 40s, 50s, or 60s with my wife of the same age. We're sitting in reading chairs pointed towards a window and slanted a bit towards one another, reading books silently while putting one of our hand on top of the others on some type of small round coffee table. There's also a small dog (yorkie) between our chairs sleeping. Outside (through the window) are our kids (or grandkids) playfully wresting with each other on our green lawn in the suburbs. Also, on the walls of our room are memories my wife and I had with one another and with our kids.
Could you draw that for me? It'd bring a lot of happiness in my life seeing a visual representation of my dream. And I really think I need that happiness right now. If you can't draw it for me, then thanks for reading this. :)
